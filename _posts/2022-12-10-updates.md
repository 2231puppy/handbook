Vanilla OS is a point release distribution that receives 2 new releases annually Security updates and bugfixes for system components are distributed 
between releases, usually without any new features introduced.

## Difference between Update and Upgrade

"Updates" refers to new versions of packages that bring minor improvements, 
bug fixes, and security updates. These are normally installed in the background 
and do not make any noticeable changes to the system.

With "Upgrade" instead, we refer to the transition from one release of 
Vanilla OS to another, for example from 22.10 to 23.04. These, in addition to 
the usual bug fixes and security updates, are new features and potentially 
obvious changes to the system.

## Update Vanilla OS

Updates in Vanilla OS are managed by VSO (Vanilla System Operator), the utility
that manages the operating system. VSO performs weekly or monthly updates in the
background, without any user intervention. Since Vanilla OS is a transactional system, the
updates are applied only after a reboot.

### Configure VSO

VSO can be configured to best suit your needs. The following are the available options:

- **Smart Update:** If enabled, VSO will check whether the system is capable of 
performing an update without hindering the user experience. This is done by
performing multiple checks, such as the connection, memory, CPU and battery
status. If the system is not capable of performing an update, VSO will skip it
and try again later. If disabled, VSO will perform the update without any
further checks.
- **Schedule:** VSO can be configured to perform updates at fixed intervals, such as
weekly or monthly. The default setting is set to perform updates at weekly intervals.

#### Configure via Control Center

VSO can be configured via the Vanilla Control Center. To do so, open it
from the Applications menu, then click on the "Updates" tab and configure the
options as you wish.

#### Configure via Console

To configure VSO via the console, use the following commands:

```bash
# check the current configuration
sudo vso config show

# check a specific option
sudo vso config get update.smart

# update a specific option
sudo vso config set update.smart true
```

### Force an update

If you want to force an update, you can do so by acting as the system operator,
using the following command:

```bash
sudo vso trigger-update --now
```

## Upgrade to a new release

Vanilla OS checks for a new release in the background and then displays a
dialog to the user when a new one is available.

The user can then choose to upgrade or postpone it to the next boot.
