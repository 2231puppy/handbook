### Package Manager

Choose your preferred package managers. These are the ways you will be able to install applications. If unsure, leave it on the default \(Flatpak\). You can install the required dependencies for each one later if you change your mind.

### NVIDIA® Drivers

### Open VM Tools

If you are running Vanilla OS inside a virtual machine, you will be prompted to install Open VM Tools to use with the VM. If unsure, it is recommended to skip this step.
