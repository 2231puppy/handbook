## Introduction

Congratulations, you now have Vanilla OS installed.
This guide will help you set your system up for the first time.

## First Setup app

After booting into Vanilla OS for the first time, you will be presented with a First Setup app. This section will guide you through each page in the app.

### Color Scheme

Your preferred color scheme. Default \(meaning that apps decide for themselves\) or Dark. This can be changed later in the Settings app.

### Package Manager

Choose your preferred package managers. These are the ways you will be able to install applications. If unsure, leave it on the default (Flatpak). You can install the required dependencies for each one later if you change your mind.

### Restricted Codecs

This will install popular patented codecs and fonts. Recommended for most users.

### Extra Settings

Extra system settings. If unsure, it is recommended to leave them on the default.

### NVIDIA® Drivers

If you have an NVIDIA® graphics card, you will be prompted to install proprietary drivers for your card to improve compatibility and performance. Recommended for most users.

### Open VM Tools

If you are running Vanilla OS inside a virtual machine, you will be prompred to install Open VM Tools to use with the VM. If unsure, it is recommended to skip this step.

## Other Settings

You can find other options in Settings, Vanilla OS Control Center or tweak your graphical environment in GNOME Tweaks.

We hope you will have a great time using Vanilla OS!
