# Vanilla OS Handbook
This is the official handbook for Vanilla OS. It contains tutorials, guides and other information to help you get the most out of your Vanilla OS installation.

## Writing a guide
If you want to write a guide for the handbook, you can do so by adding the
new article to the `_posts` folder. The filename must be in the format
`YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Then open a new pull request.
